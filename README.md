## Apple Sales Data Mart - A BI Project
The final project repository for the BI Systems Development course at Experis Academy. This project is dedicated to crafting a comprehensive BI solution created for Apple's sales department, featuring a data mart and reports developed in Power BI.

### Project Overview

1. **Project Specifications:** Planning the data mart and reports, including crafting essential documents such as the ERD and Source-to-Target Mapping. These artifacts provided the foundational blueprint for subsequent development phases.

2. **Data Mart Development:** Using SSIS for the ETL process to load OLTP data from the PriorityERP database, transform it, and load it to the final Data Mart tables. Many data quality assurance tests were conducted throughout this process to maintain data integrity. The resulting data mart comprises one fact table, four dimension tables, and one history table.

3. **Power BI Reports**: This phase involved creating additional tables, calculated columns, and measures using DAX to support the envisioned visualizations and, subsequently, proceeding to craft and design the visualizations. 3 Reports were created: an Executive Dashboard, a Sales Analysis Report, and a Customer Sales Analysis Report.
